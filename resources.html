            <h3>Scarcity</h3>
            <p>Scarcity is the fundamental economic problem of having seemingly unlimited human wants in a world of limited resources. It states that society has insufficient productive resources to fulfill all human wants and needs.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Resources are limited.</li>
                <li>Wants are unlimited.</li>
                <li>Scarcity leads to the need for allocation and choice.</li>

            <h3>Opportunity Cost</h3>
            <p>Opportunity cost is the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen. It is a key concept in economics and is used to ensure efficient use of scarce resources.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Every choice has a next best alternative.</li>
                <li>Opportunity cost is the value of the foregone alternative.</li>
                <li>It helps in decision-making and prioritization.</li>

        <section id="supply-and-demand" class="resource-detail">
            <h3>Supply and Demand</h3>
            <p>Supply and demand are the fundamental forces that drive the market economy. The relationship between supply and demand determines the price of goods and services.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Law of Demand:</strong> As price decreases, quantity demanded increases.</li>
                <li><strong>Law of Supply:</strong> As price increases, quantity supplied increases.</li>
                <li><strong>Equilibrium:</strong> The point where supply equals demand.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="market-equilibrium" class="resource-detail">
            <h3>Market Equilibrium</h3>
            <p>Market equilibrium is the state where the supply in the market is equal to the demand in the market. It is the point at which the quantity of goods supplied equals the quantity of goods demanded.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Equilibrium Price: The price at which quantity supplied equals quantity demanded.</li>
                <li>Surplus: When quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded.</li>
                <li>Shortage: When quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Economic Efficiency</h3>
            <p>Economic efficiency is when the economy or an economic system is using its resources to the maximum potential to produce goods and services in the most efficient way possible.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allocative Efficiency: Resources are allocated to produce the combination of goods and services most wanted by society.</li>
                <li>Productive Efficiency: Goods are produced at the lowest possible cost.</li>
                <li>Dynamic Efficiency: The economy's ability to shift resources and innovate over time.</li>
